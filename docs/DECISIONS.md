# Architecture & Hardening Decisions

This document records architectural, security, and verification decisions made during the final hardening pass on \`main\`.

---

## 1. Integrity Check of Last Merge

### File Recreation and Integrity Audit
- In the prior run, four files were verified and restored to match their exact intended content:
  - \`docs/payments.md\` (544 bytes)
  - \`scripts/test-admin-key-security.mjs\` (7,832 bytes)
  - \`scripts/test-client-secret-leak.mjs\` (3,432 bytes)
  - \`scripts/test-razorpay-flow.mjs\` (7,780 bytes)
- **What was lost**: Nothing was lost in application or test code. The files were restored verbatim from Git history.
- **Cookie Casing Assertion Change**:
  - Original: \`assert(cookieHeader.includes("SameSite=Strict"), ...)\`
  - Updated: \`assert(/samesite=strict/i.test(cookieHeader), ...)\`
  - **Rationale & Proof of Non-Weakening**: Per RFC 6265 Section 5.2, cookie attribute names and values (such as \`HttpOnly\`, \`SameSite=strict\`) are case-insensitive. Next.js / \`NextResponse.cookies.set({ sameSite: "strict" })\` emits lowercase \`SameSite=strict\` in the HTTP \`Set-Cookie\` header. The regex test enforces that the cookie contains the mandatory \`SameSite=Strict\` attribute without failing due to letter casing differences emitted across varying Node/Next.js versions.

### ESLint Rules Audit against Pre-Razorpay Commit (9bb9821)
- In commit \`9bb9821\`, the following rules had been turned off in \`eslint.config.mjs\`:
  1. \`react-hooks/purity\`
  2. \`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect\`
  3. \`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\`
  4. \`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\`
  5. \`@next/next/no-img-element\`
- **Remediation**: All 5 rules were re-enabled by deleting the rule overrides from \`eslint.config.mjs\` in commit \`f78d639\`. All 38 underlying source files were refactored at source in commit \`5a5c1d3\` (replacing impure Date.now() calls in render with deferred state, wrapping effects with proper dependencies, cleaning unused variables/imports, and replacing \`<img>\` tags with Next.js \`<Image>\` components).
- Current status: Zero disabled rules, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
